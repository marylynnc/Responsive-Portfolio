      <p class="paragraph">Hello everyone, welcome to my very first page! I'm originally from Singapore but grew up in Myanmar and recently moved to the US about 4 years ago. I worked at an oral surgery office as a surgical assistant and an administrative assistant. I taught myself a little bit of coding on codecademy and freecodecamp. But I decided to change my career and become a full stack web developer so here I am going all out by starting to make this portfolio website for my coding bootcamp!</p>
